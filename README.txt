To run this demo, first ensure if you have the necessary pre-requisites:

Prerequisites:
--------------

gRPC Python is supported for use with Python 2.7 or Python 3.4 or higher.

Ensure you have pip version 9.0.1 or higher:

$ python -m pip install --upgrade pip

If you cannot upgrade pip due to a system-owned installation, you can run the example in a virtualenv:

$ python -m pip install virtualenv
$ virtualenv grpcDemo
$ source grpcDemo/bin/activate
$ python -m pip install --upgrade pip

Install gRPC:

$ python -m pip install grpcio

Install gRPC tools

Pythonâ€™s gRPC tools include the protocol buffer compiler protoc and the special plugin for generating
server and client code from .proto service definitions.

To install gRPC tools, run:

$ python -m pip install grpcio-tools googleapis-common-protos

Run the Demo:
-------------

Now open two terminals with the virtual environment 'grpcDemo' activated.

In one terminal, run the server:
$ python read_fileSection_server.py

In the other terminal, run the client:
$ python read_fileSection_client.py

*NOTE: The 'large' file for testing the program is hardcoded in the code and kept at the location: "./files/stdio.h"
